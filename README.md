### Topics Implemented

#### Core Implementations
- Arrays and dynamic memory management  
- Linked Lists: singly, doubly, and circular  
- Stacks and Queues (array- and pointer-based)  
- Strings and matrices: basic operations, duplicate detection, sparse matrix representation  
- Recursion examples (factorial, Fibonacci, nested and indirect recursion)  
- Sorting algorithms: bubble, insertion, selection, quick, merge  
- Trees: binary and binary search trees (insertion, traversal, height, leaf counting)  

#### Studied Concepts
- Time and space complexity analysis using recurrence relations  
- Hashing and collision resolution (conceptual)  
- Graph fundamentals (BFS / DFS to be implemented later)  
- **Greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and backtracking:** studied at a conceptual level, with pseudocode understanding of problems such as knapsack, N-Queens, and shortest path.

All algorithms were implemented in C++, both manually (non-STL) and using STL containers for comparison, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and memory behavior.  
This repository represents a comprehensive practical foundation for further study in systems and distributed computing.
